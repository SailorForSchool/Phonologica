# List Of To Dos!

## General (low priority)
- create requirements file / conda yml
- add word boundary handling for generator / test for data
- add no context handling for generator
- add rule interaction generation

## Algorithmic (high priority)
- generate datasets
- make sure rules are numbered
- implement infering one rule
  - NOTE: format correctly
- implement combining rules (put in correct spot)
- implement checking rules pairwise
- implement generating new surface forms (from og, not intermediate)
- implement iteration

## Questions
Does prague have a good way to compare (in equality) numpy arrays? (Hashable Array?)
- Would love to use (if ARRAY in LIST_OF_ARRAYS:)
- ^ will work out of the box
